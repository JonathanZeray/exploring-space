# Project Name: Exploring Space

## Description

Exploring Space is an educational website dedicated to providing an immersive and interactive experience for visitors to learn about space and its planets. This project was developed as part of the "Exploring Code" course at our school, where we aimed to incorporate various technological, strategic, and experiential techniques covered in the course.

The website offers a captivating challenge to visitors, engaging their attention and motivating them to explore further. Through a series of interactive elements and gameplay mechanics, users embark on a journey to conquer the challenge while learning fascinating facts about space along the way. The website culminates in a rewarding and rich experience, leaving visitors with a sense of accomplishment and a deeper understanding of the wonders of the universe.

## Technologies Used

- React: We built the website using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allowed us to create dynamic and responsive components, enhancing the overall user experience.

- React Three Fiber: To bring the 3D elements to life, we utilized React Three Fiber, a React renderer for Three.js. This powerful combination enabled us to seamlessly integrate captivating 3D visuals into the website.

- GSAP and Framer Motion: We employed GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Framer Motion libraries to create smooth and visually appealing animations throughout the website. These animation libraries added an extra layer of interactivity and polish to the user interface.

- JavaScript Audio Constructor: To enrich the user experience, we leveraged the JavaScript Audio Constructor to incorporate audio elements into the website. The carefully selected sounds and music enhance the ambiance and immerse visitors further in the space exploration journey.

- A-Frame for VR: As part of our commitment to delivering an immersive experience, we integrated A-Frame, a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. This allowed users to explore space in virtual reality, providing a truly engaging and memorable encounter.

## Project Management

We adopted a systematic approach to project management to ensure smooth collaboration and timely delivery of the Exploring Space website. Here are the tools and methodologies we utilized:

- Jira: We leveraged Jira for task management, issue tracking, and version control. It allowed us to create tickets, create branches, and submit pull requests efficiently. Additionally, we conducted sprint reviews using Jira to evaluate our progress and plan for subsequent sprints.

- Notion: For comprehensive documentation and overall scheduling, we relied on Notion. This versatile platform helped us maintain project documentation, organize resources, and establish a shared knowledge base.

## Achievements

Our efforts and dedication paid off, as the Exploring Space project received an honorable mention (third place) at our school's competition for the best project. This recognition validates the hard work and creativity we poured into the development process.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

Working with new technologies posed some challenges throughout the project. We had to familiarize ourselves with tools like React Three Fiber, GSAP, Framer Motion, JavaScript Audio Constructor, and A-Frame. However, overcoming these obstacles allowed us to expand our skill sets and gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies.

The ideation phase also presented its own set of challenges as we brainstormed and refined our concept for the website. Collaborative discussions and iterative design processes were instrumental in shaping the final product.

Overall, this project provided valuable lessons in creative development, 3D modeling using Spline app, project management, and team collaboration. It solidified our passion for creative development and inspired us to pursue similar endeavors in the future.

## To sum it all up

Exploring Space is the culmination of our efforts to create an engaging, educational website that sparks curiosity and fascination for space exploration. Through the use of technologies like React, React Three Fiber, GSAP, Framer Motion, JavaScript Audio Constructor, and A-Frame, we have crafted an interactive experience that hopefully leaves visitors inspired and a bit more enlightened.
